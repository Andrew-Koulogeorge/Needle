# Needle
This repository contains my implementation of the "Needle" deep learning framework (modeled after PyTorch) from the Carnegie Mellon course [10714 Deep Learning Systems](https://dlsyscourse.org/lectures/). I self-studied this course between my first and second semester while a Masters student in the School of Computer Science. 

This implementation is from my own self-study and may contain errors. Its also not 100% complete (still a few things to finish up in hw4) 

If you are interested in self-studying 10714 in the future, I highly recommend it! One thing to keep in mind is that only local test cases are currently available for people not enrolled in the course. This can make self-study frustrating if one is not careful with their design, as local test cases are NOT sufficient to guarantee the correctness of your code. I recommend writing your own test cases to ensure correctness. This will save you significant headaches as you progress through the assignments, as all the code you write for this course builds on itself.

If you have any questions about my implementation or the course material in general, feel free to reach out to me at andrewkoulogeorge@gmail.com
