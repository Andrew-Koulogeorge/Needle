# Needle
This repository contains my (working) implementation of the "Needle" deep learning framework from the CMU course [10714 Deep Learning Systems](https://dlsyscourse.org/lectures/). 

I am currently working through this course to gain a first principle, bottom-up understanding of modern deep learning frameworks.
